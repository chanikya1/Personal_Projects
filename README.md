## Overview

Welcome to my **Personal Projects** repository! The projects in this repository were developed as part of my **Cloud Computing** course (CIS 655) at Grand Valley State University during the Winter 2024 semester. These projects provided me with hands-on experience and deepened my understanding of cloud technologies, which I could directly apply to solve real-world problems.

Before pursuing my studies in the USA, I worked at **Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS)** in India for **GSK** (GlaxoSmithKline), where I gained practical experience in cloud technologies, specifically with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. My role involved working with cloud services to optimize and streamline processes, making the transition into GVSU's Cloud Computing course seamless. This course allowed me to expand on that foundational knowledge by learning how to implement more advanced cloud-based solutions, utilizing tools and services like **GCP**, **AWS**, **Cloud Functions**, **Pub/Sub**, **Cloud Logging**, and more.

These projects helped me build a diverse skill set that I can leverage to design and implement scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solutions in the cloud. This repository will showcase the various cloud projects Iâ€™ve completed, each demonstrating different aspects of cloud infrastructure and services.

### Key Learnings from My Previous Experience:

During my time at **CTS for GSK**, I was actively involved in projects that required leveraging GCP for real-world applications. Some key aspects included:

- **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: I was involved in setting up and managing cloud resources, helping ensure optimal configuration for cost-effectiveness and reliability.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: I worked on automating backup systems and developing disaster recovery strategies using GCP, which is directly reflected in the "Triggering Notifications for Google Cloud Events" project.
- **Cloud Automation**: I gained significant experience in automating cloud operations, an area where I further advanced my skills during my Cloud Computing course at GVSU.
